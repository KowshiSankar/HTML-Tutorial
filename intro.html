    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;HTML is an acronym which stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.</p>
    <p><strong>Hyper Text:</strong>HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Markup language:</strong> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Web Page:</strong> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.</p>
    <p>Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.</p>
